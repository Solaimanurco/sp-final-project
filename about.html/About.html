        <h2>Planing</h2>
        <p>We basically do this plan to bring back some of our oldest traditions again and again. In the past, there were many traditional things in our country that we loved very much. But almost all of these things are now almost extinct.Such as nakshikantha, copper casket, jamadani saree, Tangail saree, folk and crafts, whole clay ornaments etc. All these things were available in different parts of our country but now we want these things easily. That's why we want to ship our extinct goods to everyone again. Luxury good and there are many people who want to collect these old traditional things are not easy to get, but they take these reasons, we want these things collected and sell them through the online market to reach everyone. They can easily buy or collect all these things. So we plan this online marketplace to bring our traditional products back to everyone.And this is our main purpose.  </p>
